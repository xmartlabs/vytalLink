Application environments are taken from the environments folder. 
This folder contains the environment variables used by the application, such as API keys, and other files.

The default environment variables for all environments are defined in `default.env`.

To specify environment variables for a specific environment, you can create a file with the name of the environment, for example, dev.env for development environment.
To specify private environment variables for a specific environment, you can create a file with the name of the environment and the suffix .private, for example, dev.private.env for development environment.
