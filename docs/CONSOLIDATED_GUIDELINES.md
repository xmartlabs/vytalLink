# Consolidated Guidelines and Principles

This document serves as a unified reference for the key guidelines and principles derived from the Landing Plan, Home Restructure Plan, and Onboarding Copy documents. These guidelines reflect the strategies and practices that have been implemented and will continue to guide the project moving forward.

## Core Guidelines

### 1. Value Proposition
- **Headline**: Turn your wearable data into AI-ready insights—without giving up control.
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Fast insights without dashboards.
  - Cross-metric comparisons for sleep, workouts, steps, and recovery.
  - Privacy control with granular consent for data sharing.
  - GPT-first convenience with optional MCP integrations.

### 2. Onboarding Principles
- **Lead with Benefits**: Highlight the value of understanding wearable data with AI.
- **Assistant-Agnostic Messaging**: Focus on GPT-first as the fast path while remaining open to other assistants.
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Ensure onboarding steps are clear, actionable, and scannable.
- **Privacy Emphasis**: Mention privacy in descriptions where relevant.

### 3. Home Screen Design
- **North-Star Messaging**: Surface "What’s in it for me" first with benefit-led headlines.
- **User Guidance**:
  - Clearly explain connection steps and app requirements.
  - Reinforce constraints like the need to keep the app open during use.
- **UX Principles**:
  - Lead with benefits in headlines and CTAs.
  - Provide inline guidance and progressive disclosure for detailed steps.
  - Maintain consistent vocabulary (e.g., "Get Word + PIN").

### 4. Feedback Integration
- Address user confusion about connection steps and app usage.
- Simplify processes to reduce friction and improve clarity.
- Ensure all feedback is incorporated into active documents.

## Key Changes (Merged from Summaries)

### Simplified User Guidance
- Unified messaging across Landing, Home, and Onboarding to ensure clarity.
- Introduced a consistent 3-step process: Get Word + PIN, Open ChatGPT/Claude, Start Asking.
- Emphasized the importance of keeping the app open during sessions.

### Privacy and Trust
- Reinforced privacy messaging: "Your data, your control."
- Highlighted the app’s stateless design and granular consent for each connection.
- Ensured users understand that no data is stored on servers.

### Assistant-Agnostic Approach
- Positioned ChatGPT as the fast path while supporting Claude and MCP Advanced.
- Clarified that chats happen in external assistants, not within the app.
- Maintained flexibility for future assistant integrations.

### Enhanced User Experience
- Improved state-driven content on the Home screen to guide users through connection states (Offline, Starting, Running, Error).
- Added inline checklists and microcopy to reduce confusion.
- Simplified onboarding screens with benefit-led messaging and actionable insights.

### Telemetry and Optimization
- Introduced basic telemetry to track user interactions and refine messaging.
- Planned A/B testing for headlines and CTAs to optimize engagement.
- Focused on iterative improvements based on user feedback and data.

## Recommendations

### Monitor and Iterate
- Use telemetry data to refine messaging and CTAs.
- Continue A/B testing to identify the most effective headlines.
- Gather feedback to identify any remaining pain points.

### Maintain Consistency
- Ensure alignment between Landing, Home, and Onboarding messaging.
- Regularly update copy based on user feedback and app changes.

### Scalability
- Designed messaging and features to support future assistants and integrations.
- Kept implementation light-touch to allow for rapid iteration.
