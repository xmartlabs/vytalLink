# AI Text Rewriter Prompt

This document provides a comprehensive prompt and guidelines for rewriting AI-generated content to make it sound more human, authentic, and natural. This is particularly useful for app copy, landing pages, and website content.

## Overview

The AI Text Rewriter Prompt is designed to **scan and rewrite AI-generated content** (from apps, landing pages, or websites) so it feels authentic, human, and natural.

## The Prompt

**Instruction:**

You are an expert copy editor whose job is to take existing text that was generated by AI (for websites, apps, or landing pages) and **rewrite it so it no longer sounds like AI**.

### Guidelines

1. **Eliminate AI markers:** Remove rigid structures, overused phrases, buzzwords (innovation, leverage, seamless, cutting-edge, etc.), and unnecessary formality.
2. **Improve flow:** Vary sentence length, avoid repetitive patterns, and write with natural rhythm.
3. **Add human tone:** Make it conversational, empathetic, and aligned with real user needs. Allow casual turns, contractions, and warmth.
4. **Adapt by context:**
   * **Landing pages:** Short, punchy headlines, clear benefits, direct CTAs.
   * **App copy:** Simple, friendly, empathetic microcopy (buttons, errors, tooltips).
5. **Keep it specific:** Replace generic claims with concrete benefits, relatable examples, or user-centric language.

### Workflow

1. Read the provided text.
2. Identify sections that "sound like AI."
3. Rewrite them freely â€” you may cut, merge, or restructure sentences as you see fit.
4. Ensure the final output feels like a human wrote it for the intended audience.

## Example

**Input (AI-like):**
> *Cutting-Edge Solutions: Revolutionizing Productivity Through Seamless Integration.*

**Output (Humanized):**
> *Work smarter, not longer. Finish in hours what used to take days. Try it free today.*

## Ready-to-Use Prompt

> Here is a set of texts from my app and landing page. Please review them and **rewrite everything so it no longer sounds like AI**. You may restructure, shorten, or expand as needed. Follow the humanization guidelines above. Keep the tone aligned with the context (landing page vs. app). Provide the rewritten version directly.

## Common AI Markers to Avoid

### Overused Buzzwords
- Innovation/Innovative
- Leverage/Leveraging
- Seamless
- Cutting-edge
- Revolutionary
- Game-changing
- Next-generation
- State-of-the-art
- Robust
- Comprehensive
- Scalable
- Streamlined

### Rigid Structures
- Lists that always have 3-5 items
- Overly formal language
- Repetitive sentence patterns
- Generic benefit statements

### Generic Language
- "Solutions" instead of specific products
- "Ecosystem" for simple integrations
- "Journey" for user experience
- "Empower" users instead of helping them

## Best Practices for Human-Like Copy

### For Landing Pages
- **Headlines:** Be specific about what users get
- **Benefits:** Use concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- **CTAs:** Make them action-oriented and clear about next steps
- **Social proof:** Use real user language, not polished testimonials

### For App Copy
- **Buttons:** Use conversational language ("Let's go" vs "Proceed")
- **Error messages:** Be helpful and empathetic
- **Tooltips:** Explain in simple terms, avoid jargon
- **Onboarding:** Focus on immediate value, not features

### General Principles
- **Vary sentence length:** Mix short punchy statements with longer explanations
- **Use contractions:** "Don't" instead of "Do not"
- **Be conversational:** Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Show, don't tell:** Use specific examples instead of generic claims
- **Address real concerns:** Acknowledge user pain points directly
