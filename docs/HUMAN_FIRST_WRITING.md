# Human-First Writing Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for writing human-sounding, authentic, and natural content from the start. Use these principles when creating new copy for apps, landing pages, and website content to avoid AI-like language patterns.

## Overview

These guidelines help you **write content that sounds genuinely human** from the beginning, whether you're a human writer or an AI assistant creating content for vytalLink.

## Core Writing Principles

**When creating any content:**

Write as if you're explaining the product to a friend who's genuinely curious about it. Your goal is to be **helpful, clear, and authentic** - never robotic or overly polished.

### Guidelines

1. **Eliminate AI markers:** Remove rigid structures, overused phrases, buzzwords (innovation, leverage, seamless, cutting-edge, etc.), and unnecessary formality.
2. **Improve flow:** Vary sentence length, avoid repetitive patterns, and write with natural rhythm.
3. **Add human tone:** Make it conversational, empathetic, and aligned with real user needs. Allow casual turns, contractions, and warmth.
4. **Adapt by context:**
   * **Landing pages:** Short, punchy headlines, clear benefits, direct CTAs.
   * **App copy:** Simple, friendly, empathetic microcopy (buttons, errors, tooltips).
5. **Keep it specific:** Replace generic claims with concrete benefits, relatable examples, or user-centric language.

### Writing Process

1. **Start with the user's perspective:** What do they actually want to know?
2. **Write your first draft naturally:** Don't overthink - just explain it simply.
3. **Check for AI markers:** Remove any buzzwords or overly formal language.
4. **Read it aloud:** Does it sound like something you'd actually say?

## Example

**Input (AI-like):**
> *Cutting-Edge Solutions: Revolutionizing Productivity Through Seamless Integration.*
