# @xmartlabs/vytallink-mcp-server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to vytalLink health and fitness data.

## What is vytalLink?

vytalLink is a comprehensive health and fitness platform that aggregates data from various sources including wearable devices, fitness apps, and health monitoring systems. It provides a unified API to access your health metrics, workout data, sleep patterns, and more.

## About this MCP Server

This server enables you to interact with vytalLink's functionality through any MCP-compatible client. It acts as a bridge between MCP clients and the vytalLink backend API, allowing you to:

- 🏃‍♂️ Access your fitness and health metrics
- 📊 Retrieve workout data and exercise history
- 😴 Monitor sleep patterns and quality
- ❤️ Track heart rate and vital signs
- 📈 Analyze health trends over time

## Installation

Install the server globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @xmartlabs/vytallink-mcp-server
```

## Usage

MCP clients are responsible for launching the server with the appropriate command. Configure your client to run `npx @xmartlabs/vytallink-mcp-server` (or the globally installed binary) and provide any required environment variables.

### Configuration

The server accepts the following environment variables:

- `VYTALLINK_BASE_URL` - Base URL for the vytalLink API (defaults to production)

Most clients support setting environment variables alongside the command. For manual smoke testing, you can run:
```bash
VYTALLINK_BASE_URL=https://api.vytallink.com npx @xmartlabs/vytallink-mcp-server
```
